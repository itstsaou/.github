# Hi there 👋

We are a student organization at [Ohio University](https://www.ohio.edu/) that aims

1. To provide support and foster a sense of togetherness among the Thai students at Ohio University and strengthen our sense of community among ourselves and other members of the larger Ohio University community.
2. To serve as cultural ambassadors of Thailand and raise awareness of Thailand and Thai culture among the student body at Ohio University for the purpose of fostering cross-cultural understanding and fellowship.
3. To further development leadership skills, collaboration and cross-cultural interaction.
